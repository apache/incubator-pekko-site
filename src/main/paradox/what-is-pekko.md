# What is Pekko?

Apache Pekko is an open-source framework for building applications that are concurrent, distributed, resilient and elastic.
Pekko uses the Actor Model to provide more intuitive high-level abstractions for concurrency.
Using these abstractions, Pekko also provides libraries for persistence, streams, HTTP, and more.

Apache Pekko is a fork of [Akka](https://github.com/akka/akka) 2.6.x, prior to the Akka project's adoption of the Business Source License.

## Disclaimer

Apache Pekko (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache
Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the [Apache Incubator](https://incubator.apache.org/) PMC.

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
fully endorsed by the ASF.
