Pekko uses the Actor Model to provide more intuitive high-level abstractions for concurrency. Using these abstractions, Pekko also provides libraries for persistence, streams, HTTP, and more.\nApache Pekko is a fork of Akka 2.6.x, prior to the Akka projectâ€™s adoption of the Business Source License.","title":"What is Pekko?"},{"location":"/what-is-pekko.html#disclaimer","text":"Apache Pekko (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.\nIncubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.\nWhile incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.","title":"Disclaimer"},{"location":"/modules.html","text":"","title":"Apache Pekko Modules"},{"location":"/modules.html#apache-pekko-modules","text":"pekko (core) docs api japi pekko-http docs api japi pekko-grpc docs api pekko-connectors docs api pekko-connectors-kafka docs api pekko-management docs api pekko-persistence-cassandra docs api pekko-persistence-dynamodb GitHub pekko-persistence-jdbc docs api pekko-persistence-r2dbc docs api pekko-projection docs api\nWe are still working on fixing up the docs for some Pekko modules.
